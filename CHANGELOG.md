## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **One-line install + prebuilt binaries**: releases now ship cross-compiled,
  CGO-free binaries for macOS/Linux (amd64/arm64) and Windows (amd64) via
  GoReleaser (`.github/workflows/release.yml` on tag `v*`). Install without a
  toolchain through the `install.sh` script (`curl -fsSL …/install.sh | sh`),
  Homebrew (`brew install enowdev/tap/enowx-rag`), npm (`npm install -g
  enowx-rag`, a thin wrapper that fetches the native binary), `go install
  …/cmd/mcp-server@latest` (the dashboard is embedded from a committed build),
  or by downloading a release archive directly. Adds `enowx-rag version`
  (`--version`), with the version stamped at build time via ldflags.
- **Settings page** to manage API keys and the admin token from the dashboard:
  view keys masked (`GET /api/setup/config`), reveal full keys
  (`/config/reveal`, localhost or admin token), update a key
  (`POST /api/setup/config`, merged into config.yaml 0600), and generate an
  admin token (`POST /api/setup/gen-token`, shown once, saved to config). The
  admin token now takes effect from either `RAG_ADMIN_TOKEN` (precedence) or the
  saved config, read per-request so a generated token works without a restart.
- **More MCP tools** (6 → 11): `rag_list_projects` (discover projects + chunk
  counts), `rag_project_exists`, `rag_list_points` (inspect indexed chunks),
  `rag_delete_points` (remove stale chunks without a full re-index), and
  `rag_stats` (projects/chunks/embed-model/latency/tokens). Thin wrappers over
  existing core.Service methods; available over stdio and remote HTTP.
- **MCP over HTTP (remote daemon)**: `enowx-rag --serve` now also exposes the MCP
  server at `/mcp` (Streamable HTTP transport, stateless), so agents can use
  enowx-rag as a centralized remote daemon — e.g. on a VPS — instead of a local
  stdio process. It's gated by the same `RAG_ADMIN_TOKEN` bearer as `/api`.
  Connect a client with `{ "url": ".../mcp", "headers": { "Authorization":
  "Bearer <token>" } }`. Local stdio mode is unchanged.
- **Agent setup**: point an AI agent at `GET /api/docs/setup` and it configures
  enowx-rag for a project, idempotently. `GET /api/setup/probe` reports what's
  already installed (MCP per client, skill, AGENTS.md block) so finished steps
  are skipped; `POST /api/setup/write-agents-md` merges an enowx-rag section into
  the project's AGENTS.md via `<!-- enowx-rag:start/end -->` markers (create /
  append / update, preserving the user's own content). The Install step shows a
  short copy-paste prompt.
- **Migration** page + engine: re-embed a project's stored text into a new
  destination to change embedding model/dimension or move between vector stores
  (Qdrant/pgvector/Chroma). Raw vectors aren't copied (they're model-specific);
  the text — stored alongside every chunk — is re-embedded by the destination.
  `POST /api/migrate` runs asynchronously with live SSE progress; the UI shows a
  progress bar and offers to delete the source after success.
- **Cloud import**: pull from an external vector DB and re-embed. Qdrant Cloud is
  verified (reuses the tested Qdrant provider); Pinecone, Weaviate, and Chroma
  Cloud connectors are **experimental** (built from vendor docs, mock-tested
  only — not verified against a live account) and labelled as such in the UI.
- OpenAI-compatible embedder (`RAG_EMBEDDER=openai`): works with any
  `/v1/embeddings` API — OpenAI, Together, Jina, Mistral, a local Ollama,
  LiteLLM, etc. — via `RAG_OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `RAG_OPENAI_MODEL` /
  `RAG_OPENAI_API_KEY` / `RAG_OPENAI_DIM`. Surfaced in the wizard's Embedding
  step, which also clarifies that TEI serves any local model.
- Query metrics: latency (avg/p50/p95), Voyage token usage, and dense/lexical
  retrieval breakdown, exposed at `GET /api/metrics` and shown on the dashboard.
  Persisted durably to `~/.enowx-rag/metrics.db` (pure-Go SQLite, no cgo), so
  metrics survive restarts on any backend.
- `compress` search option: deterministic near-duplicate result dedup.
- `enowx-rag setup [--run]` CLI subcommand to generate/run the backend
  docker-compose (never over HTTP).
- Efficient project chunk counts (`points/count` / `COUNT(*)` / `/count`),
  making `/api/projects` and `/api/stats` fast on large Qdrant/pgvector.
- Qdrant & Chroma now implement project listing, so the dashboard works on all
  backends, not only pgvector.

### Changed
- MCP `rag_semantic_search` / `rag_retrieve_context` now accept and apply
  `hybrid`/`rerank`/`recall`/`compress` (hybrid & rerank default on).
- Dashboard shows only real, backend-sourced data — removed all mock/hardcoded
  metrics, dead controls, and the fake auto-setup simulation.
- **Breaking:** `rag_retrieve_context` returns `chunks` as references
  (`id`, `score`, `meta`) instead of full chunk objects. The document text was
  previously present three times in one response — in `context`, in
  `chunks[].Content`, and again in `chunks[].Meta["content"]`. The `context`
  string already carries every chunk's text with its score, so callers should
  read it from there.
- Search results and exported documents no longer repeat the document text
  under `Meta["content"]`; it is returned once, in the content field.
- `rag_list_points` accepts an exact-match `filter` on any metadata key (not
  just `source_file`), and `PointInfo` now carries the remaining payload tags
  in `meta` — needed when a collection holds agent memory tagged with
  `bucket`/`kind`/`ts` rather than a code index.

### Security
- `/api/setup/apply` and `/api/setup/test` require localhost or a valid admin
  token; `/api/setup/apply` no longer echoes the saved config (API key) back.
- Removed the deprecated `middleware.RealIP` (X-Forwarded-For spoofing risk).
- `rag_index_project` no longer embeds `.env` files. `.env` was in the
  indexable-extension allowlist, so a scanned project's `.env` (and any
  `*.env`) was read and sent to the configured embedding provider, then
  persisted in the vector store. Sibling forms (`.env.local`,
  `.env.production`) were already skipped. A second `isSensitive()` gate now
  also blocks names that are otherwise indexable — `secrets.json`,
  `db_password.yml`, `credentials.yaml` — plus key material, so the guarantee
  no longer depends on the extension allowlist never growing.

### Notes
- The Chroma provider is **experimental** (legacy `/api/v1`, mock-tested only);
  use Qdrant or pgvector for a supported setup.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-12

First tagged release. A per-project RAG memory skill and MCP server for AI
coding agents, distributed as a single self-contained binary.

### Added

- **MCP server** (stdio) exposing per-project RAG tools: create/delete project,
  index, retrieve context, semantic search.
- **Vector store providers**: Qdrant, Chroma, and pgvector, behind a common
  `rag.Provider` interface (one project = one collection).
- **Embedding backends**: Voyage AI (with Matryoshka `output_dimension` and
  `input_type=query`/`document` split) and self-hosted TEI.
- **Reranking**: Voyage `rerank-2.5` integrated into search (retrieve → rerank →
  top-k), disable-able and with graceful fallback.
- **Hybrid search** on pgvector: dense + lexical full-text fused with
  Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF, k=60) over a GIN `tsvector` index.
- **HTTP + web UI** (`--serve`): chi-based REST API, Server-Sent Events activity
  stream, and an embedded React dashboard (Overview, Playground, Chunks) served
  from the single binary via `embed.FS`.
- **Onboarding wizard**: guided setup for vector store, embedder, and connection
  testing.
- **Incremental indexing**: `content_hash` / `chunk_version` metadata so
  unchanged chunks are skipped on re-index; `embed_model`/`embed_dim` recorded.
- **Auth**: optional `RAG_ADMIN_TOKEN` protecting `/api/*` with constant-time
  comparison.
- **Packaging**: Makefile build pipeline and an all-in-one Docker Compose.

### Security

- SSE event stream (`/api/events`) is same-origin only by default; cross-origin
  access must be explicitly enabled via `RAG_CORS_ORIGIN`.
- Reranked result sets are defensively truncated to `k` regardless of the
  rerank API response.
