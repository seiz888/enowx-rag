# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

We take the security of enowx-rag seriously. If you discover a vulnerability,
please report it **privately** — do not open a public issue.

**How to report:**

- Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/enowdev/enowx-rag/security/advisories/new)
  (Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability), or
- Email the maintainer at the address listed on the
  [GitHub profile](https://github.com/enowdev).

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- Affected version / commit
- Your suggested remediation, if any

## What to expect

- We aim to acknowledge your report within **3 business days**.
- We will keep you informed as we investigate and work on a fix.
- Once a fix is released, we will credit you in the advisory unless you prefer
  to remain anonymous.

## Scope

This project is an MCP server and skill that handles:

- API keys for embedding/reranking providers (e.g. Voyage AI) via environment
  variables
- An optional admin token (`RAG_ADMIN_TOKEN`) protecting the HTTP `/api/*`
  endpoints
- Content indexed from user codebases, stored in a vector database

Areas of particular interest for security reports include: authentication
bypass on the HTTP API, cross-project data leakage, SSRF/injection in the
vector-store or embedding requests, and secret exposure in logs or responses.

## Hardening notes for operators

- Set `RAG_ADMIN_TOKEN` when exposing the `--serve` HTTP API beyond localhost.
- The SSE event stream (`/api/events`) is same-origin only unless you set
  `RAG_CORS_ORIGIN` — leave it unset in single-origin deployments.
- Never commit `RAG_VOYAGE_API_KEY` or other secrets; pass them via the
  environment or your MCP client config.
- Configure `RAG_GUARD_PROJECTS` for shared memory collections. The guard checks
  known credential formats and explicit credential assignments in content,
  identifiers, and metadata before embedding. Migration validates the complete
  export before creating or writing its destination. This conservative check is
  not a general PII classifier: authors must still keep private data in a vault.
- Malformed or unreadable authentication configuration fails closed with HTTP
  503. A missing configuration file still supports intentional local onboarding;
  public deployments must set an admin token through the environment.
